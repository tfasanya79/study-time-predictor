# Study Time Predictor

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI-powered web application that predicts how long students will take to master specific topics based on their learning characteristics, study context, and historical performance data. Uses TensorFlow neural networks to provide personalized study time estimates with confidence ratings through an interactive web interface.

## Background

Learning time estimation is a critical challenge in educational planning that affects millions of students worldwide. Current problems include:

* Students consistently underestimate study time requirements, leading to poor planning and stress
* Educators lack data-driven tools to provide accurate time estimates for coursework
* One-size-fits-all approaches ignore individual learning differences and optimal study conditions
* Manual time tracking is inconsistent and doesn't account for learning style variations

My personal motivation stems from experiencing academic stress due to poor time estimation during my studies. This topic is important because accurate time prediction can:
* Improve academic performance through better planning
* Reduce student stress and anxiety
* Help educators design realistic curricula
* Enable personalized learning experiences

The problem is frequent - every student faces time estimation challenges daily when planning study sessions, and educational institutions need better tools for curriculum design.

## How is it used?

The Study Time Predictor is used by students, educators, and academic advisors to make data-driven decisions about study planning and curriculum design.

**Primary users and use cases:**
* **Students**: Plan study sessions, allocate time for different subjects, and optimize learning schedules
* **Educators**: Design realistic assignments and provide accurate time estimates to students
* **Academic advisors**: Help students with course planning and workload management
* **Learning centers**: Optimize tutoring sessions and resource allocation

**Usage process:**
1. Select or create a student profile (learning style, education level, focus duration)
2. Choose a topic from the library (Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
3. Set study context (time of day, environment, energy level, study method)
4. Receive AI prediction with confidence rating
5. Analyze performance trends through the analytics dashboard

The solution is needed in academic environments where time management is critical:
* **Environment**: Schools, universities, online learning platforms, libraries, study centers
* **Timing**: Before exams, when planning semesters, during homework assignments
* **Context**: Both individual study planning and institutional curriculum design

Here's how the prediction algorithm works:
```python
def predict_study_time(student_profile, topic_data, study_context):
    # Feature engineering
    features = [
        student_profile['age'],
        student_profile['education_level_encoded'],
        student_profile['learning_style_encoded'], 
        student_profile['avg_focus_duration'],
        topic_data['difficulty_level'],
        topic_data['content_type_encoded'],
        study_context['time_of_day_encoded'],
        study_context['energy_level'],
        study_context['environment_encoded']
    ]
    
    # Neural network prediction
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    confidence = calculate_confidence(features, historical_data)
    
    return {
        'estimated_hours': prediction[0],
        'confidence_score': confidence
    }
## Data sources and AI methods

**Data Sources:**
The application uses synthetic data generated to simulate realistic learning scenarios:
* **Student profiles**: 30 diverse learners with varying characteristics (age 18-35, different education levels, learning styles)
* **Topic library**: 25+ topics across 5 subjects with difficulty ratings and content types
* **Study sessions**: 600+ historical sessions with completion times and performance outcomes

*Note: In a production environment, data would come from:*
* Learning Management Systems (LMS) like [Canvas API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/) or [Moodle Web Services](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Web_services)
* Student information systems
* Time tracking applications
* Educational assessment platforms

**AI Methods:**
The core AI uses a **feedforward neural network** implemented with TensorFlow/Keras:

| Component | Details |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Architecture | Multi-layer dense network (128→64→32→16→1 neurons) |
| Input Features | 15 variables: student characteristics, topic metadata, session context |
| Activation | ReLU for hidden layers, linear for output |
| Regularization | Dropout (0.3) and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting |
| Training | 150 epochs with early stopping, 80/20 train/validation split |
| Loss Function | Mean Squared Error (regression problem) |
| Optimizer | Adam with learning rate scheduling |
| Performance | MAE: 0.99 hours, RMSE: 1.39 hours |

**Feature Engineering:**
* **Student features**: Age, education level encoding, learning style encoding, average focus duration
* **Topic features**: Subject encoding, difficulty level, content type encoding, prerequisites count
* **Context features**: Time of day encoding, study method encoding, environment encoding, energy level, distraction level

## Challenges

**What the project does NOT solve:**
* **Motivation and engagement**: Cannot predict or improve student motivation levels
* **Learning quality**: Focuses on time estimation, not comprehension or retention quality  
* **Real-time adaptation**: Doesn't adjust predictions during study sessions based on performance
* **Individual learning disabilities**: May not accurately account for specific learning challenges
* **External factors**: Cannot predict impact of personal circumstances, health, or stress

**Limitations:**
* **Data dependency**: Accuracy relies on sufficient historical data for similar student-topic combinations
* **Context sensitivity**: Predictions may be less accurate for unusual study conditions
* **Cold start problem**: New students or topics without historical data receive less accurate predictions
* **Cultural bias**: Training data may not represent diverse cultural learning approaches

**Ethical considerations:**
* **Privacy**: Student learning data is sensitive and requires careful handling and consent
* **Bias amplification**: AI might perpetuate existing educational inequalities if training data is biased
* **Overreliance**: Students might become too dependent on predictions rather than developing self-awareness
* **Pressure creation**: Predictions could create additional stress if students can't meet estimated times
* **Algorithmic fairness**: Must ensure predictions are fair across different demographic groups

**Deployment considerations:**
* Transparent about prediction limitations and confidence levels
* Allow users to provide feedback to improve model accuracy
* Implement privacy-by-design principles
* Regular bias auditing and model retraining with diverse data
